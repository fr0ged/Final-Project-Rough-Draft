# Micro-organism Identification

 This project uses images from a pre-given dataset to predict images of microorganism and help find viruses.

## The Algorithm

The my-recognition file trains the model and uses the images from the dataset with train, test, and val. Unfortunetly I didn't have enough time with office hours and my Nano's VSCode did not work. I could not connect with SSH and could not find any other way to connect(there was no more office hours to ask for help). I am truly sorry and I tried my best.

## Running this project

1. Run the code and start with training the model, then uploading images you want to test.
2. You need Resnet to be able to recognize the photos.
